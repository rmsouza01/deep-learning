# Deep Learning course

In this github repo, I share materials corresponding to two courses that I teach at the University of Calgary:

- ENEL645 - Data Mining & Machine Learning 
- ENSF 619.02 - Advanced Image Analysis and Machine Learning


This repo is constantly being updated. Initially, we used TensorFlow as the deep learning, but we will be adding PyTorch examples since it is the dominant deep learning framework at the moment.
